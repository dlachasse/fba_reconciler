This project downloads Amazon Merchant reports via Amazonâ€™s Marketplace Web Service API. This is really only intended for internal use and includes static values that only apply to our config file.Note that the `Database` class is intended to utilize the TinyTDS library for interacting with SQL Server. You can feel free to customize as needed.

Batch files are included for scheduling tasks.
